exceptiongroup
==============

Welcome to `exceptiongroup <https://github.com/python-trio/exceptiongroup>`__!

A way to represent multiple things going wrong at the same time, in
Python.

This project is currently maintained by the `Trio project
<https://trio.readthedocs.io>`__, but the goal is for some version of
it to be merged into Python 3.8, so it can be used in both Trio and
asyncio. For more information, see:
https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/611

For a more recent effort, see:
